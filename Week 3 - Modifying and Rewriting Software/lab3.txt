I used the following commands in the following order to fix the bug in
Coreutils-7.6:

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
to grab Coreutils-7.6 in tarball format.

I untarred and unzipped coreutils-7.6.tar.gz in the home directory:
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I made a temporary directory to compile and install Coreutils:
mkdir coreutilsInstall

cd coreutils-7.6 to go inside this directory so as to compile it.

To compile and install Coreutils-7.6 inside the temporary directory made above,
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/jayant/coreutilsInstall
The prefix sets the target for the 'make' command.

I compiled Coreutils-7.6 in the correct directory by running
'make' command
in the current directory (coreutils-7.6).

I installed it using the 'make install' command

Now, I changed my working directory to : coreutilsInstall (i.e. the temporary
directory created which has the tarball installed).

Output (one line) of ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 2 jayant csugrad 8192 Feb  3 17:10 bin

Output (one line) of ./bin/ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 2 jayant csugrad 8192 2018-02-03 17:10 bin

The line above shows the bug!

In the coreutils-7.6 directory:
I make a path file called path_file.diff using the command emacs path_file.diff
I run the command
patch -p1 < path_file.diff
to apply the patch.

Then I run the make command to rebuild the patched ls.

In the temporary directory, coreutilsInstall, I run the command ./bin/ls -l
and the output still remains the same:
drwxr-xr-x 2 jayant csugrad 8192 Feb  3 17:10 bin

In coreutils-7.6 directory, I run the command ./src/ls -l and the output is
fixed to this:
-rw-r--r--  1 jayant csugrad   80541 Sep 18  2008 ABOUT-NLS

TESTING:
1. I made a new file: emacs rob.txt
./src/ls -l outputted:
-rw-r--r--  1 jayant csugrad       6 Feb  3 17:24 ron.txt

2. For an old file:
Changed the date: touch -t 201401181205.09 ron.txt
./src/ls -l outputted:
-rw-r--r--  1 jayant csugrad       0 Jan 18  2014 lol2.txt
