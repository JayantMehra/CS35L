Used the following commands:
To download the old version of coreutils:
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter18/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

Untarred it:
tar -xvfz coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

Made a temperory directory:
mkdir coreutilsInstallWithBug

cd coreutils-with-bug
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/jayant/coreutilsInstallWithBug
make
--> This runs into an error and make command cannot be finished because there
are two functions with the same name but different parameters.

I copied the patch to patchFile.diff
Applied it:
patch -p0 < patchFile.diff

make
make install

DEBUGGING
gdb /w/home.12/cs/ugrad/jayant/coreutilsInstallWithBug/bin/ls
info functions

Since they are listed according to their mtimes, I step into the function: 'compare_mtime'

(gdb) break compare_mtime
(gdb) run -lt
After multiple 's':
static int compare_mtime (V a, V b) { return cmp_mtime (a, b, xstrcoll); }
static int compare_mtime (V a, V b) { return cmp_mtime (a, b, xstrcoll); }
int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;

If b.tv_sec is very high, then the difference causes an integer overflow in the
negative direction which wraps around to give a positive integer indicating
that b is larger.

I quit out of gdb : quit

I cd into coreutils-with-bug

I make a copy of the timespec.h file and make the required changes:
cp timespec.h ./lib/timespec.h

diff timespec ./lib/timespec.h > patchTime.diff

Changed the diff to have ./lib/timespec.h

Copied it to lab4.diff

patch -p0 < patchTime.diff
make
make install

Works:

Created a change log.

The home directory in the seasnet server is 32-bit. Thus, the time of old file
is wrapped around to give a date in the future and shows 2054 as the date of
creation and puts it in the top.
The temp directory was 64 bit and was able to handle the dates well.
