1. Log for the homework?!

2. In the diffutils directory, from the master branch,
   git checkout 'v3.0' -b "quote"

3. patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt to apply the new patch.
   It succeeds.

   patching file src/cmp.c
   patching file src/diff.c
   patching file src/diff3.c
   patching file src/dir.c
   patching file src/sdiff.c
   patching file src/util.c

4. Read the documentation for C-x 4 a. It allows the create a ChangeLog file
   to be associated with the commit.

5. For every file, I ran the command C-x 4 a in emacs and wrote an appropriate
   message.

   * util.c: changes ` to '

   * sdiff.c: changed ` to '

   * dir.c: changed ` to '

   * diff3.c (diff_type): changed ` to '

   * diff.c: changed ` to '

   * cmp.c: Changed ` to '

6. git commit -F src/ChangeLog
   When I run git log, I can see my commit (i.e. with my name etc).
   The message associated with it is the content of the ChangeLog:

   commit ad014b6a07aae62d869d6ef0f5a95121c2168e9e

7. git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt
   This creates the new patch in the quote branch and saves it in the
   formatted-patch.txt file in the current directory.

8. By accident, my src/diff3.c has two random characters 'OB' at the start of the
   file so when the patch is applied, you have to manually change it.

   My lab partner was Hoang Nguyen. We emailed each our patches to each other.

   After tranferring it to the directory:
   git checkout v3.0 -b partner to create a new branch
   git am formatted-patch.txt (it was in some directory so as to make sure the
   correct one was applied.)

   make check finishes successfully. Tested it by running a src/diff command and it
   produces the correct output.

9. make distdir
   The command creates a directory and I cd into it
   cd diffutils-3.0.1-ad01-dirty/

   The ChangeLog has recorded my entry.

10. I sshed back into the server with -X flag.
    ssh -x jayantlnxsr06.seas.ucla.edu
    cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
    gitk
    In the X11 window, searched for merge and took a screenshot.
