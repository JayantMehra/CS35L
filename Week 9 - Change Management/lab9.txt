1. I copied the diffutils directory in git format using the following
command:
git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils

2. git log > git-log.txt
3. git tag > git-tags.txt
4. Found the commit using:
   git log --oneline | grep maint:\ quote\ \'like\ this\'\ or\ \"like\ this\",\ not\ \`like\ this\'

   Made the patch with the following command:
   git format-patch -1 62ca21c --stdout > quote-patch.txt

5. Checked out Version 3.0
   git checkout v3.0 -b new3.0

6. patch -p1 < quote-patch.txt . In a couple of cases it was not able to figure
   where to apply the patch. I skipped past those files. Therefore, a few hunks
   failed.

7. git status
   Prints out all the modified files which are both being tracked and not. There
   were no files in the staging area currently.

8. Used the provided links to learn about vc-diff and vc-revert.

9. Using C-x v u, I revert all the changes made in the non .c files. To make the
required changes in the .c files, I searched for the new text (i.e. the one with
the +) and made the required changes by hand. Also used M-g M-g to go to specific
lines (as indicated by the change) if search did not work.

10. Applied all the rejected patches to src/diff.c and src/diff3.c manually i.e.
    changed ` to ' at multiple locations.

11. Removed some of the files manually or used the following command to delete:
    find . -type f -name '*.orig' -delete

12. git diff > quote-3.0-patch.txt
    This creates a patch.

13. ./bootstrap
    Then I create a patch and apply it with the patch command.
    ./configure
    make
    make check (Had to change some file in tests (as written in piazza)) to make
    it to work. Also, was in lnxsrv01 so did not have to apply the patch.

    Verification for the src/diff works as it produces the same output as the
    normal diff. That is without the grave accents and just the apostrophe.

14. I made the two directories using mkdir command.
    I cloned the original directory in a temp folder and copied all .c files
    from Version 3.0 to diffutils-3.0 and then copied the c files from my diffutils
    folder to diffutils-3.0-patch.
    ./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch >quote-3.0-test.txt
    to produce the required file and

15. diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt diffutils/quote-3.0-patch.txt
    to produce the diff output.

    All of the differences are innocuous since most pertain to some kind of file
    paths or regarding grave accents and apostrophes.
